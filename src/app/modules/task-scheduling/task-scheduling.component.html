                <p>Food safety and quality management requires a myriad of tasks of different types. Whether it’s management reviews, internal audits, pre-planned maintenance or performance reviews, all can be scheduled and assigned to relevant staff. This ensures that all tasks are completed and a full audit trail of results are stored in the system for verification during audits.</p>
                <p>The highly flexible multi-frequency scheduler allows scheduling into the future, e.g. the 1st Monday of each month or annually. Users may opt to receive email alerts when tasks are due on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
                <p>Tasks are also generated automatically by the document review engine and the Action engine so that key activities are raised and assigned to relevant staff. In addition, it’s easy for tasks to be re-assigned to other team members when staff are on holiday or move to another job.</p>
