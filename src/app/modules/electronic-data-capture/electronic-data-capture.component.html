                <p>HACCP Now has a built-in forms designer that allows the creation of printed and electronic forms. Using a simple drag and drop interface, the user may design any type of form and this can be published electronically or printed for paper use. The electronic forms may be integrated with other systems, for example, to pull product batch information from the traceability or production systems.</p>
                <p>The Data Form Designer allows the role based electronic sign off and support text, numeric and date based data capture. All numeric data can be graphed and reported on and alerts may be configured to be sent when limits are breached.</p>
                <p>Electronic forms may then be completed at the point of use, e.g. on the shop floor, where data can be entered in real time on touch screen windows based PC panels. This ensures that, where possible, paper and double keying of information is eliminated. It also ensures that real time alerts may be generated for production, food safety and quality purposes.</p>
                <p>For more information on how we can help you with all aspects of HACCP, contact us now. We are always happy to provide a free consultation or arrange a full demo of our software. Alternatively, visit out our sister site to find out more about connected food safety:
