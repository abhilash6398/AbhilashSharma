                <p>HACCP Now has a built an e-learning platform that allows users to take courses loaded into the system. The courses are multi-media based and are created from Powerpoint presentations that you may provide to us. The content may be generic, such as Principles of HACCP for Managers or specific to your organisation. In each case there are clear learning outcomes defined and a bank of practice and final test questions.</p>
                <p>The system allows linking to online resources external to HACCP Now in order to provide a wider, more realistic, learning experience.</p>
                <p>At every stage the user can monitor their progress and, when ready, can take the final test. Once the user has completed a course they can print, or email, a PDF certificate with your business logo on it. The certificate is permanently stored in the system and is accessible for as long as the user has access.</p>
                <p>For more information on how we can help you with all aspects of HACCP, contact us now. We are always happy to provide a free consultation or arrange a full demo of our software. Alternatively, visit out our sister site to find out more about connected food safety:
