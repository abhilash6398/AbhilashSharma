                <p>Product specifications are a crucial part of any food safety management system. By taking a joined-up approach to supplier management, food safety policies and the needs of your customer, you can have a system that stands up to scrutiny and works in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
                <p>Product specifications need to be aligned with your customer requirements and key food safety standards such as the BRC Global Food Safety Standard, ISO 22000, SQF and other globally benchmarked standards.</p>
                <p>Gathering and maintaining all the necessary information to support this can become a burden. HACCP Now takes care of this by allowing you to maintain all the elements of a product specification in a controlled fashion.</p>
                
                <p>HACCP Now’s product specification module covers the following areas:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Full product details, description, composition, packaging and labelling details</li>
                    <li>Support for COSHH and Legislative claims</li>
                    <li>Micro, Physical and Analytical standards</li>
                    <li>Full recipe and nutritional breakdown</li>
                    <li>Free from claims</li>
                    <li>HACCP information</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The product specification module’s fast and easy to use interface ensures that a product specification can be created and approved in minutes. This can then be sent instantly by email to the relevant customer for their signature and return.</p>
