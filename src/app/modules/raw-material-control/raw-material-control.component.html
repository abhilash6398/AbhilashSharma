                <p>Controlling raw materials used to be based on trust and testing, it is now based on data gathering. HACCP Nowâ€™s Supplier Raw Material portal provides all the tools you need to gather detailed supplier raw material information. After setup, the process is automated and allows you to focus on assessing the information entered rather than chasing suppliers for information.</p>
                <p>If your food business has a lot of suppliers, the overhead of managing this important task can be very significant, often requiring teams of full time staff just to chase and input information into spreadsheets, word documents and other systems.</p>
                <p>HACCP Now allows you to design an automated Supplier Raw Material questionnaire and schedule it to be sent to the supplier on a suitable frequency. This means your team is freed up to focus on reviewing the performance of suppliers and drive up the quality, price point ratio through continuous improvement.</p>
                <p>For more information on how we can help you with all aspects of HACCP, contact us now. We are always happy to provide a free consultation or arrange a full demo of our software. Alternatively, visit our sister site to find out more about connected food safety:
