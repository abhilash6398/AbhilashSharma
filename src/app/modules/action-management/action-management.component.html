                <p>Whether it’s corrective action, preventative action or other types of action, HACCP Now’s powerful Action Management tools help you capture and deal with issues in an intuitive and fast way.</p>
                <p>The system helps capture and manage related information in a logical way that helps identify trends and smooth the process of resolution and future prevention.</p>
                <p>The Action Management module is fully integrated with all other parts of HACCP Now, notably Workflow, Tasks and Risk Management, thus allowing workflows to automatically initiate assigned tasks to individuals to a pre-set process.</p>
                <p>This means that certain types of issue must be risk assessed in a certain way. It also means that risk assessments raised in the action module are then visible in the Risk Register and must be reviewed according to the overall level of confidence and volatility.</p>
                <p>The ability to automate such processes greatly reduces the administrative overhead of running the quality, food safety and compliance aspects of a food business helping reduce costs and risks whilst automatically driving continuous improvement.</p>
                <p>This module is designed to be used for corrective and preventive actions, customer complaints, quality, food safety and quality issues and non-conformities and much more.
                    What’s more, the Action Management module integrates directly with the Audit Module from where it can receive non conformities and also pass back resolution information.</p>
                <p>This module will help streamline operations by reducing the need for constant management meetings, to identify actions and issues and review progress. It provides the information required to be able to allocate resources more effectively and, most importantly, to ensure that all issues are prioritised correctly and receive the visibility they deserve.</p>
                <p>In short, the Action Management module makes sure that important issues that may harm the business, its customers or staff, do not go unaddressed and a full audit trail of best practice activities accompany every type of action.</p>
