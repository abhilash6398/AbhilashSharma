                <p>Risks occur within all stages of the food production process from the supplier, transport, storage, processing and production. A good food safety system will prioritise the resources it uses according to risk on an ongoing basis. However, many systems fail to log and monitor risk on an ongoing basis. The main reason for this is that risk assessments are often carried out in isolation and stored in a spreadsheet with no wider visibility or review.</p>
                <p>HACCP Now Live takes a different approach by allowing risk assessments to be carried out on any aspect of the food safety management system, raw material, supplier or operation. The process is fast and effective and allows the user to measure risk volatility and confidence in addition to the actual risk itself. This approach is critical to understanding when risks need to be reviewed and therefore in ensuring that the occurrence of unexpected food safety or quality events is minimised. In this way the product integrity and risk to the consumer and brand is minimised in a proactive way.</p>
