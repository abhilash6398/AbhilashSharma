                <p>Managing cleaning effectively is a pre-requisite to an effective food safety programme. This involves understanding what food manufacturing and processing equipment exists, how it is to be cleaned, who will do this and when. HACCP Now Live contains all the tools to be able to document the cleaning procedures, assign cleaning tasks and check the effectiveness of the cleaning programme.</p>
                <p>Cleaning effectiveness can be monitored closely through live cleaning records and audits that raise non conformities that are recorded and managed to a conclusion within the Action module of HACCP Now Live. This approach means overall performance can be improved and a highly effective regime of cleaning and disinfection is maintained.</p>
                <p>For more information on how we can help you with all aspects of HACCP, contact us now. We are always happy to provide a free consultation or arrange a full demo of our software. Alternatively, visit out our sister site to find out more about connected food safety:
