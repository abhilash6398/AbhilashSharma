                <p>Management of suppliers has always been important but itâ€™s never been as important as it is right now. Today, food businesses search the globe for raw materials and ingredients that meet their price, quality and risk criteria in order to remain competitive.</p>
                <p>The globalisation of food supply chain and networks continues to grow and as it does new risks emerge that simply were not present a few years ago, or even a few months ago. The high profile horsemeat scandal, and the hundreds of other hidden food safety and food fraud incidents that happen every day, have resulted in ever more scrutiny on the supply chain. This has been reflected in national and global food safety standards and resulted in ever more scrutiny of your management of suppliers.</p>
                <p>Watch our video below for a demo on how our software system can help you with supplier management.</p>

                <p>The important areas of supplier management, from a food safety and quality perspective, revolve around assurance and approval to supply one or more products or raw materials. They also impact traceability, supplier audits and supplier non conformity management.</p>
                <p>HACCP Now provides a Supplier Management module that allows your business to ensure that it stays on top of supplier approvals through audits and automated questionnaires. It also ensures that product approvals are tracked and renewals are automated, where possible and relevant. The system tracks non conformities logged against a supplier so that their performance can easily be monitored.</p>
                <p>The Supplier Raw Material portal (see Raw Material Control) integrates with the Supplier Management module in order to have the supplier keep their information up to date in order to reduce the time and overhead of your business having to do most of the work in maintaining records relevant to suppliers. It also gives you tools to track assurance status and emerging issues with particular suppliers.</p>
                <p>For more information on how we can help you with all aspects of HACCP, contact us now. We are always happy to provide a free consultation or arrange a full demo of our software. Alternatively, visit our sister site to find out more about connected food safety:
