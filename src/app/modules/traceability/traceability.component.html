                <p>HACCP Now‘s Traceability module is currently under development and is expected to be released in early spring. Here’s what to expect when it’s released.</p>
                <p>Many traceability systems are stand-alone systems, often as part of the food business’s SAP or ERP system. Most businesses, especially small and medium sized businesses, tend to track raw materials and products on spreadsheets and paper forms. Such an approach often means it may take hours or sometimes days to carry out a traceability challenge or product recall. With every moment that passes, increasing the cost of a product recall or the risk of harm to consumers, this time lag is dangerous for a food business’s financial and reputational health, in addition to the impact on the consumer.</p>
                <p>HACCP Now takes a different approach. We believe that traceability should be built into an overall integrated Food Safety Management System as traceability is fundamentally a food safety and quality issue, not a production issue. Traceability needs to be able to track at what process step the contamination or problem occurred so that the system can identify the area where things need to change.</p>
                <p>Food safety, quality and other management records like maintenance, cleaning and labeling controls need to be available to search in a cross referenced way against any particular raw material or product trace so that the root cause may be identified quickly and accurately and measures put in place to prevent recurrence.</p>
                <p>The traceability module in HACCP Now will produce a trace, back or forward, and ‘possible causes’ list of activities that took place for the affected batch of finished product or raw materials.</p>
                <p>HACCP Now traceability is integrated with the actions module and can raise actions against production lines, product batches can also highlight the need for a trace and automate the recall process. A workflow is then activated that automates the recall process, including the management steps to approve a recall.</p>
                <p>Since HACCP Now can be integrated with your SAP or ERP system there is no reason to accept a second best traceability solution.</p>
