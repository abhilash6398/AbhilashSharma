                <p>The HACCP Now food safety dashboard is a crucial part of ensuring that you, and your colleagues, stay up to date with relevant issues to do with food safety and quality in your food business.</p>
                <p>It uses report ‘widgets’ to let you see what is overdue and, where relevant, who is holding things up across your organisation. It also shows what has been accomplished and gives a view on the ‘overall health’ of your food safety management system in percentage terms. This approach avoids the pre-audit panic to review everything in order to identify what needs updated.</p>

                <p>The food safety dashboard also helps identify resource bottle necks so you can deal with them and avoid surprises at audit time due to team members not having the time to complete tasks.</p>
                <p>It’s not all big brother though, as the system gives everyone a transparent view of things, it fosters a team approach to getting resources allocated and sharing the workload.</p>
              <p>Users can decide which dashboard widgets they wish to see and whether they want to see the dashboard on system start up.</p>
              <p>The dashboard also displays real-time alerts so that everyone knows what’s going on in the business. Alerts can be configured in the system on almost anything.</p>
